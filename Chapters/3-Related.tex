\subsection{SCIFI} SCIFI \cite{SCIFI} is a centralized channel allocation protocol for infrastructure Wireless LANs that improves the traditional graph-coloring algorith DSATUR. 
		And while it shows that their central coordinator in fact improves the throughput compared to Wireless LANs that are not configured by SCIFI, the algorithm is just an algorithm for setting 
		a channel in a preconfigured adminstrative domain. It does not deal with how the administrative domains (or collaborative groups as we call it) are defined.
