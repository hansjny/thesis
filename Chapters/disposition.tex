%\section {Introduction part}
%\begin{itemize} 
%\item Introduction to the wifi interference problem
%\item Taking a step back and looking at other attempts on solving the problem
%\item Begin presenting Torleiv and Magnus work, the idea, and maybe the p2p protocol.
%\end{itemize}

%\section {Main thesis part}
%\subsection{Group allocation algorithm} 

%\begin{itemize} 
%\item The problem.
%\item Possible solutions? References.
%\item Complexity, out of scope for thesis. Assume problem is solved.
%\end{itemize} 
%\subsection{The algorithm itself} 
%\begin{itemize} 
%\item Elaborating on the problem, introducing the first algorithm suggestion.
%\item Explain simulation data creation with stochastic uniform distribution.
%\item Show how the group creation algorith was created, design decisions (iterations etc).
%\item Results with visualizations through the visualization tool. 
%\item Evaluate results and consider improvements. How will this work in the wild?
%\item Introduce SSB data, the data format and why it is relevant. How is the tool made.
%\item Same procedure with result visualization and result evaluation. Do we still need improvements?
%\item Introducing Wigle as data source. Show results on map?
%\end{itemize}

%\section {Concluding part}
%\begin{itemize} 
%\item Have we created a meaningful algorithm that can be implemented in hardware?
%\end{itemize}
